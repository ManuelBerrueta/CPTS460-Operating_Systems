The program computes the sum of an integer array. The number of array elements (10) is defined in the memory location
labeled N, and the array elements are defined in the memory area labeled Array. The sum is computed in R0, which is saved
into the memory location labeled Result. As before, run the mk script to generate a binary executable t.bin. Then run t.bin
under QEMU. When the program stops, use the monitor commands info and xp to check the results. Figure 2.5 shows the
results of running the C2.2 program. As the figure shows, the register R0 contains the computed result of 0x37 (55 in
decimal). The reader may use the command

Use the command arm-none-eabi-nm t.elf to view the symbols with their appropriate address then you can call from
within qemu xp /wd 0xaddress
